Problem Statement 

Online fraud is increasing and spreading rapidly across geographies and industries, and Mobile Payments represent a significant portion of the growth in both overall transaction and fraud rates. While attempting to detect and prevent fraud, the accuracy of the prediction models can have a significant impact on the ability to strike the right balance between true detection and false positives. The customer experience can be severely compromised by security measures enacted on the basis of a false positive. The fraud rate has a measurable impact on revenue, and new types and methods of fraud are evolving in response to successful detection and prevention efforts.    
Dataset
Due to privacy concerns, there is little if any publicly available data for real transactions. PaySim.csv is a simulation of mobile money transactions with the objective to generate a synthetic transactional data set that can be used for research into fraud detection. 
 
The dataset for this project is from the following link on Kaggle:
